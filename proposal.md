# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will be Discord Bot: Music Curator


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")


A music curator that discord users can use to play music in a voice channel

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?


My software will allow people to call the discord bot into a voice channel and allow the user to select a song to play. It will allow people to skip a song or to add more songs to the playlist of the songs to be played by the discord bot. This will occur with a user inputting a command that will drag the bot into the voice channel of the person who is using the command for the bot. Then, anyone in the voice channel of that user will be able to skip or input another song selection in the playlist of songs to be played by the discord bot. Also, the user will be able to input a link to a song that will be played on the bot.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to implement a discord bot that will be able to play songs through the bot and allow the user to skip or add songs to the playlist of the bot. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I think I will be able to implement a discord bot that will allow a user to input a song name and it will play the song that the user inputted. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to develop a discord bot that can easily find the exact song a person has inputted, and will allow the user to skip, shuffle or add to the playlist of songs being played. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to first learn how to create a discord bot bedfore making a program for it. Then, I will need to research how I can gather a large music library so that when a user inputs a certain keyword they will get the song they were looking for. Also, I will need to understand which songs are playable as I know there are copyright issues for music on discord bots. As for creating the program, I think will need to have multiple functions for each input the user will enter such as if they want to skip a song or want to remove a song from the playlist. I will need to connect a music streaming platform to the discord bot so it pulls music from that platform when the user enters an input.
